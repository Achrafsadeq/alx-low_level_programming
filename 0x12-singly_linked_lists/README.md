| Global Variables | Not allowed |
| Functions per File | No more than 5 |
| Allowed C Standard Library Functions | malloc, free, exit |
| Additional Allowed Function | _putchar |
| Header File | lists.h (include guarded) |

## Data Structure

 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node

 * Description: singly linked list node structure


## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Print all the elements of a list_t list. | 0-print_list.c |
| 1 | Return the number of elements in a linked list_t list. | 1-list_len.c |
| 2 | Add a new node at the beginning of a list_t list. | 2-add_node.c |
| 3 | Add a new node at the end of a list_t list. | 3-add_node_end.c |
| 4 | Free a list_t list. | 4-free_list.c |
| 5 | Print a message before the main function is executed. | 100-first.c |
| 6 | Write a 64-bit assembly program that prints "Hello, Holberton". | 101-hello_holberton.asm |
