0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops
Learning Objectives: Master nested loops, function usage, prototypes, variable scope, and GCC compilation flags while adhering to strict coding standards without using the standard library.

Requirements: Use specified editors, compile with strict GCC options, end files with new lines, follow Betty style, avoid global variables, limit to 5 functions per file, only use _putchar, and include prototypes in main.h.
