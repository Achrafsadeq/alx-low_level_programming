# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Diving into the Recursive Realm

Welcome to the mesmerizing world of recursion in C! This project will take you on a journey through the elegant art of self-referential problem-solving, where functions call themselves to unravel complex challenges.

### The Power of Self-Reference

> "To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion."

We're diving deep into the recursive rabbit hole, exploring problems that can be elegantly solved by breaking them down into smaller, identical sub-problems. Prepare to bend your mind around loops that aren't loops and witness the beauty of code that seems to fold in on itself.

## Project

> This mission, should you choose to accept it, will fortify your skills in:

* Understanding and implementing recursive algorithms
* Recognizing problems suitable for recursive solutions
* Managing stack space and avoiding infinite recursion
* Comparing iterative and recursive approaches

## The Arsenal: Recursive Toolkit

| File | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| `main.h` | The header file containing all function prototypes |
| `0-puts_recursion.c` | Print a string using recursion |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | Print a string in reverse using recursion |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c` | Calculate the length of a string using recursion |
| `3-factorial.c` | Calculate the factorial of a number |
| `4-pow_recursion.c` | Calculate x raised to the power of y |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c` | Calculate the natural square root of a number |
| `6-is_prime_number.c` | Determine if a number is prime |
| `100-is_palindrome.c` | Check if a string is a palindrome |
| `101-wildcmp.c` | Compare two strings with wildcard support |

## Mission Parameters

1. Clone the mission repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
