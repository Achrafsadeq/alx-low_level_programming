# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Description
This project focuses on bit manipulation in C programming. It covers various tasks such as converting binary to unsigned int, printing binary representation of numbers, and performing bitwise operations.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Compilation | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl |
| Global Variables | Not allowed |
| Functions per File | No more than 5 |
| Allowed C Standard Library Functions | malloc, free, exit |
| Additional Allowed Function | _putchar |
| Header File | main.h (include guarded) |
