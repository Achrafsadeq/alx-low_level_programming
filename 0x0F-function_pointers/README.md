# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Project Overview

This project focuses on function pointers in C. It includes tasks that involve creating and using function pointers for various purposes.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc. are forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header file called function_pointers.h
- All header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0. What's my name | Write a function that prints a name. | 0-print_name.c |
| 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done | Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. | 1-array_iterator.c |
| 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities | Write a function that searches for an integer. | 2-int_index.c |
| 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at | Write a program that performs simple operations. | 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h |
| 4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker (Advanced) | Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function. | 100-main_opcodes.c |

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile your code: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o output_file`
4. Run your program: `./output_file`
