# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using macros and the C preprocessor. The tasks involve creating various macros, including those for common constants and function-like macros.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Files should end with a new line
- Code should follow Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are printf and puts
- Header file (main.h) must be included and pushed to the repository

## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Object-like Macro | Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024. | 0-object_like_macro.h |
| 1 | Pi | Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359. | 1-pi.h |
| 2 | File name | Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. | 2-main.c |
| 3 | Function-like macro | Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x. | 3-function_like_macro.h |
| 4 | SUM | Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y. | 4-sum.h |
