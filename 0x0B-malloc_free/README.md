# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Project Overview

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc and free functions. It covers creating arrays, duplicating strings, concatenating strings, and working with 2D arrays.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Files should end with a new line
- Code should follow Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Only malloc and free from the C standard library are allowed
- _putchar function is allowed
- Don't forget to push your header file (main.h)

## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee | Create an array of chars | 0-create_array.c |
| 1 | The woman who has no imagination has no wings | Return a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory | 1-strdup.c |
| 2 | He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life | Concatenate two strings | 2-str_concat.c |
| 3 | If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize | Return a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers | 3-alloc_grid.c |
| 4 | It's not bragging if you can back it up | Free a 2 dimensional grid | 4-free_grid.c |
| 5 (Advanced) | It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe | Concatenate all the arguments of your program | 100-argstostr.c |
| 6 (Advanced) | I will show you how great I am | Split a string into words | 101-strtow.c |
