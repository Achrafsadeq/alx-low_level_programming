# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Unveiling the Power of Memory Manipulation

Welcome to the fascinating world of pointers, arrays, and strings in C! This project will take you on a journey through the intricacies of memory management and data structures, empowering you to write more efficient and powerful code.

### The Art of Indirection

> "A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value."

Pointers are the magicians of C programming, allowing us to perform feats of memory manipulation that would otherwise be impossible. They are created with the mystical `*` operator and open up a realm of possibilities for efficient code.

## Project Essence

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of:

- The nature and use of pointers
- Array manipulation and traversal
- String operations and their implementation
- The intricate relationship between pointers and arrays

## The Arsenal: Your Toolkit for This Journey

| File | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| `main.h` | The containing all function prototypes.|
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | Neutralize a target value, resetting it to 98. |
| `1-swap.c` | Execute a covert swap of two integer values. |
| `2-strlen.c` | Crack the code of string length. |
| `3-puts.c` | Broadcast a string to stdout. |
| `4-print_rev.c` | Reverse engineer a string. |
| `5-rev_string.c` | Flip a string on its axis. |
| `6-puts2.c` | Transmit every other character of a string. |
| `7-puts_half.c` | Divide and conquer: display the second half of a string. |
| `8-print_array.c` | Surveillance on n elements of an integer array. |
| `9-strcpy.c` | Clone a string, ensuring no intel is left behind. |
| `100-atoi.c` | Transform string intelligence into integer data. |
| `101-keygen.c` | Generate passcodes to access the 101-crackme vault. |
| `_putchar.c` | Your basic communication tool for character output. |
