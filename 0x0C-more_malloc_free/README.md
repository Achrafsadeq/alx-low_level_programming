# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Project Overview

This project delves deeper into dynamic memory allocation in C, focusing on advanced usage of `malloc` and `free`. The tasks include creating custom memory allocation functions, concatenating strings with a limit, and reallocation of memory blocks.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Files should end with a new line
- Code should follow Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Only malloc, free, and exit from the C standard library are allowed
- _putchar function is allowed
- Header file (main.h) must be included and pushed to the repository

## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Trust no one | Write a function that allocates memory using malloc |
| 1 | string_nconcat | Write a function that concatenates two strings, up to n bytes of the second string |
| 2 | _calloc | Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc and initializes it to zero |
| 3 | array_range | Write a function that creates an array of integers, containing all values from min to max inclusive |
| 4 (Advanced) | _realloc | Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free |
| 5 (Advanced) | We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope | Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers |
